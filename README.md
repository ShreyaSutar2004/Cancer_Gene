# Cancer Gene Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting cancer-related genes using a dataset of 3000 rows. By training and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, we aimed to identify the most effective model for this classification task. Our analysis revealed that both K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) achieved the highest performance, reaching an impressive accuracy of **93%**.

This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning in the fields of genomics, computational biology, and oncology studies, potentially contributing to a better understanding and identification of genes associated with cancer.
